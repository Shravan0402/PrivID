PrivID

PrivID is a privacy-preserving identity verification system leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure authentication without exposing sensitive user data.

Features
	•	ZK-Based Identity Verification – Authenticate users without revealing their credentials.
	•	On-Chain Proof Generation – Generate and verify proofs on blockchain networks.
	•	Decentralized & Trustless – No need for centralized authorities to verify identities.
	•	Cross-Chain Compatibility – Supports multiple blockchain ecosystems.
	•	Optimized Gas Costs – Efficient proof verification with minimal on-chain computation.

Tech Stack
	•	Cryptography: zk-SNARKs / zk-STARKs
	•	Smart Contracts: Solidity, Hardhat
	•	Proof Generation: Circom, Noir
	•	Frontend: React, Next.js (optional)
	•	Backend: Node.js (optional)

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Shravan0402/PrivID.git
cd PrivID


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Compile circuits:

circom circuits/identity.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym  


	4.	Deploy smart contracts:

npx hardhat deploy



Usage
	•	Generate a zero-knowledge proof for identity verification.
	•	Submit the proof to the smart contract for verification.
	•	Get on-chain confirmation of authentication.

Roadmap
	•	Implement zk-STARK support
	•	Integrate with DID (Decentralized Identity) frameworks
	•	Add cross-chain verification
